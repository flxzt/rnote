<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.flxzt.rnote'><img width="250" alt='Download on Flathub' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flxzt/rnote/main/misc/assets/flathub-badge.svg'/></a>
</div><br>

### MacOS

Thanks to @dehesselle the app is available on MacOS as an app bundle.  
Check out the [repository](https://gitlab.com/dehesselle/rnote_macos), the latest release can be downloaded [here](https://gitlab.com/dehesselle/rnote_macos/-/releases/permalink/latest).

</div><br>

### Windows

Download the Windows installer from the latest release which can be found [here](https://github.com/flxzt/rnote/releases/latest).

</div><br>

Install using [Winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/f/flxzt/rnote):

```
winget install flxzt.rnote
```

### Downgrading

Because the file format still is unstable, downgrading to a specific version might be necessary.

List all available past versions on flathub:

```bash
flatpak remote-info --log flathub com.github.flxzt.rnote
```

Pick the commit from the desired version and downgrade with:

```bash
sudo flatpak update --commit=<commit-hash> com.github.flxzt.rnote 
```

After downgrading, the flatpak version can be pinned or unpinned with:

```
$ flatpak mask com.github.flxzt.rnote
$ flatpak mask --remove com.github.flxzt.rnote
```

To update to the latest version again, unpin and run `flatpak update`.

## Pitfalls & Known Issues

* Drag & Drop not working -  
    Make sure Rnote has permissions to the locations you are dragging files from. Can be granted in Flatseal (a Flatpak permissions manager)

* Odd location for current file -  
    When the directory displayed in the header title is something like `/run/user/1000/../`, rnote does not have permissions to access the directory. Again, granting them in Flatseal fixes this issue.

* Stylus buttons move canvas / are not functional -  
    Make sure that the `xf86-input-wacom`, drivers on X11 and `libinput` on Wayland and `libwacom` are installed and loaded.

* While hovering with the stylus, other input events are blocked in some regions of the screen -  
    Supposed to be palm rejection, but might be undesirable. If there is a left- / righthanded system tablet setting, make sure it is set correctly. Rnote can't disable this unfortunately. ( discussed in issue [#329](https://github.com/flxzt/rnote/issues/329) )

* One of the stylus buttons shortcut mapping does not work as intended -  
On some devices one stylus button is mapped to a dedicated "Eraser" mode (which is the back-side on other styli). The buttons in the shortcuts settings could then be inconsistent ( the secondary / upper button is actually the primary / lower button , or reverse ). To change the tool that is mapped to this "Eraser" mode, do the following:  
    * Hover over the canvas, and press and hold the button that is suspected to be mapped to the "Eraser" mode
    * Switch to the desired pen style while keeping the button pressed
    * When releasing the pressed button, it should switch back to the previous pen style
    * The pen style in the "Eraser" mode should now be remembered
